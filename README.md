### [The Goal](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Goal-Audiobook/B00IFG88SM)

> In this intriguing business novel, which illustrates state-of-the-art economic theory, Alex Rogo is a UniCo plant manager whose factory and marriage are failing. To revitalize the plant, he follows piecemeal advice from an elusive former college professor who teaches, for example, that reduction in the efficiency of some plant operations may make the entire operation more productive. Alex's attempts to find the path to profitability and to engage his employees in the struggle involve the listener; and thankfully the authors' economic models, including a game with matchsticks and bowls, are easy to understand. Although some characters are as anonymous as the goods manufactured in the factory, others ring true. In addition, the tender story of Alex and his wife's separation and reconciliation makes a touching contrast to the rest of the book. Recommended for anyone with an interest in the state of the American economy.

### [The Lean Startup](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Lean-Startup-Audiobook/B005LXV0HI)

> The Lean Startup approach fosters companies that are both more capital efficient and that leverage human creativity more effectively. Inspired by lessons from lean manufacturing, it relies on “validated learning”, rapid scientific experimentation, as well as a number of counter-intuitive practices that shorten product-development cycles, measure actual progress without resorting to vanity metrics, and learn what customers really want. It enables a company to shift directions with agility, altering plans inch by inch, minute by minute.

#### [Notes to a Software Team Leader](https://www.amazon.com/Notes-Software-Team-Leader-Organizing/dp/829993320X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1547103596&sr=1-1&keywords=notes+to+a+software+team+leader)

> Are you an architect? Scrum Master? team leader? project manager? If you are any of these, you will find that leadership, done right, is a very tough job. This book deals with the hard parts. Not with tools, but with people. Here is the manifesto that drives this book: For us as team leaders, the goal and the way we measure our work is the overall growth in skills of self-organization and self-maintenance in each member of our team and the team as a whole. To that end: • We accept that the team's needs from us change continuously based on their skills for handling the current reality of work, so we embrace a continuously changing leadership style over a one-style-fits-all leadership approach. • We believe in challenging ourselves and our teams to always get better, so: • _ We create slack time for the team to learn and be challenged. • _ We embrace taking risks for our team over staying safe. • _ We embrace fear and discomfort while learning new skills over keeping people within their comfort zone. • _ We embrace experimentation as a constant practice over maintaining the status quo: • _ With people • _ With tools • _ With processes • _ With the environment • _ We believe our core practice is leading people, not wielding machines, so: • _ We embrace spending more time with our team than in meetings. • _ We embrace treating software problems as people problems. • _ We learn people skills and communication techniques. About the notes The second part of this book allows a peek into the minds of some of the best leaders, consultants, and managers as they give advice to a new team leader. Hear from Johanna Rothman, Kevlin Henney, Dan North, Uncle Bob Martin, and many others about the one thing they would like to teach you if you ever become a team leader, Scrum Master, project manager, or architect.

### Product

#### [Best Practices on building a UI component library for your company](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8eBXGPl_5E)

> Learn how to building an internal component library & style guide can help your company ship and iterate faster. This talk will cover how we created a scalable & maintainable UI library (http://ux.mulesoft.com) with ES6, React, and PostCSS for consumption across multiple product teams.

#### [Product vs IT Mindset](https://svpg.com/product-vs-it-mindset/)

> The role of the product organization is to consistently deliver significant new value to the business through continuous product innovation. At a startup, the product team either innovates and provides real value or the startup dies. However, in larger, more established companies, product teams very often lose their ability to deliver that ongoing value. They just make minor optimizations to existing products. Or they continue to turn out more features that don’t make a difference.

#### [Need for Speed](https://svpg.com/the-need-for-speed/)

> I’m always badgering teams about moving faster. Yet I continue to meet people and teams that not only move very slow, they don’t understand the relationship between speed and innovation, or speed and quality. In fact, many people still think those goals are at odds. I attribute this mainly to a deeply rooted Waterfall mindset.
